# EconomyDiscordBot
 The economy bot I'm creating.
 
 Currently, I am working on adding pets, digging, and fishing.
 Goal is to make it so that ores can temporarily boost your rewards from gambling.
 Pets will help you to get crops and will also be able to fetch bits.
 Fishing will have you work towards filling a collection book filled with fish, and when its full, you get a reward!
