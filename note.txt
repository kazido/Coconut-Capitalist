with some slight caveats
bot.close() will power off your bot safely, which is important rather than just crashing out to keep discord happy
if bot.close() is slow (test it!) then that's the source of your issue. if it isn't, then it's the ctrl-c handler
if you don't care about a clean exit and just want to quit now, exit(1) on a command will fix things up
the execl stuff is for when you want a restart command
Mine's just !rs
close stuff down, mark the restart as intended (to catch... a particularly annoying error..) and then come back up on it's own
takes like.. 6-7 seconds mostly because it does a lot on startup
